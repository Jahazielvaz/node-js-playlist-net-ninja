QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AJAX REQUEST
-How is it connecting to the rest of the Modules?

-Is the parameter inside the anonymous function called data, the same data that's being passed in the call called data, which contains todo.
  ANSWER: No. I removed data and realized that it's still working. I think it was simply passed down, so the data can go to a database, as well as be removed from a database. I guess mongoose can input the value of the data parameter.
-What's the purpose of the following code   var item = $(this).text().replace(/ /g, "-");
  ANSWER: This is a regular expression. It's replacing all spaces that the user inputs to dashes so that the browser can compile it properly since browsers take spaces to mean separate urls. The g stands for global.
