QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AJAX REQUEST
-How is it connecting to the rest of the Modules?
-Why are there multiple get and post requests for the same data. We have a request using express, and we have another request using jQuery.
-How are both requests related?
-Is the parameter inside the anonymous function called data, the same data that's being passed in the call called data, which contains todo.
-What's the purpose of the following code   var item = $(this).text().replace(/ /g, "-");
-Where is location.reload coming from. Is it a pre-set property?
